# PySpark Basics

This repository contains some exercises of basic PySpark stuff. I created it so I can store examples as I'm learning it. Each folder is a different project where I try something that I just learned.
If you want to look at it and learn something, go ahead! I don't promise it will always show you the best solution, but it certainly gets the work done. I tried to keep comments explaining what each line does.
